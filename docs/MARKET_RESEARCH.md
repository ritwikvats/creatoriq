# CreatorIQ - Market Research & Analysis

**Date:** February 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Research Period:** Nov 2025 - Feb 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Market Opportunity:** The Indian creator economy is experiencing explosive growth, fueled by Budget 2026's ₹4,200 crore allocation and a government target of 2M creator jobs by 2030. CreatorIQ addresses a critical gap: no tool exists that combines multi-platform analytics with India-specific business management (tax compliance, brand deal CRM).

**Key Findings:**
- TAM: 2M+ monetizing creators in India (growing to 5M by 2030)
- SAM: 200K creators earning ₹5L-50L/year, needing professional tools
- SOM: 10K paying customers achievable in Year 1 ($6M ARR)
- Competitors focus on either analytics (Social Blade) or scheduling (Hootsuite), none offer tax compliance
- Willingness to pay: ₹1,500-3,000/month to save 40 hours/month and avoid CA fees

**Recommendation:** **GO TO MARKET IMMEDIATELY**. The window is open (Budget 2026 momentum, no direct competitor in India-specific creator tools). Risk of delay: Competitors may pivot to India or new entrant may emerge.
