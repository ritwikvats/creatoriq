> **Cross-platform analytics & business tools for content creators**

Unified dashboard for YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn & X creators to track performance, revenue, and brand deals—all in one place.

## The Problem

Creators in 2026 face:
- ❌ **Siloed data**: YouTube, Instagram, Meta each show only their own analytics
- ❌ **Data loss**: Instagram only stores 90 days of history
- ❌ **No revenue tracking**: No way to track total income across AdSense, brand deals, affiliates
- ❌ **Zero business tools**: No CRM for brand deals, no tax tools, no professional reports
- ❌ **Manual work**: Exporting CSVs, building spreadsheets for brand pitches

**Result:** Creators waste 10+ hours/month on manual tracking and miss revenue opportunities.
